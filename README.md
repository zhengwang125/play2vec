# play2vec

This is the Implementation of "Effective and Efficient Sports Play Retrieval with Deep Representation Learning" (KDD 2019).

## Requirements

* Linux Ubuntu OS (16.04 is tested)
* Python (3.6 is tested)
* [Tensorflow-GPU](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu) (1.8.0 is tested)

Please refer to the source code to install the required packages such as matplotlib in Python. You can install packages with conda in a shell as

```bash
conda install matplotlib
```

## Dataset

The dataset is a real-world soccer player tracking data collected by STATS. Download the dataset by requesting [STATS Artificial Intelligence](https://www.stats.com/artificial-intelligence/) and put the compressed `*.kpl` files into `./SoccerData`. Note that the intermediate results generated by the algorithm will also be saved in this folder.

### Data format

The training kpl file contains around 7500 sequences. In each sequence, it consists of the tracking data of three parts: 11 defense players, 11 attacking players and a ball. All of these have two fields horizontal and vertical coordinates obtained at a sampling frequency of 10Hz. If you want to test your own data, please also refer to this format. More details can be found in official data instruction.

## Running Procedures

### Data Visualization

First, you can visualize the sports data by running [`preprocess.py`](preprocess.py) or play a specified segment by [`viz.py`](viz.py). Note that these two parts are supported by matplotlib and turtle packages in Python 3.6.

### Building Corpus

Run [`ogm.py`](ogm.py). It splits each play into a sequence of non-overlapping segments with a fixed duration and maps the coordinates to grids. 
```bash
python3 ogm.py
```
After such a process, you need to generate the corrupted version of noise and dropping respectively.
```bash
python3 corrupted_noise.py
```
```bash
python3 corrupted_drop.py
```
Then, building a sports corpus by calculating the Jaccard index for measuring the similarity between two segment matrices.
```bash
python3 building.py
```
### Training

Run [`embedding.py`](embedding.py). It learns distributed representation for each segment token under the Skip-Gram model. We visualize the effect of the representations through the validation data during the training process and draw the high-dimensional segment embeddings using t-SNE. 
```bash
python3 embedding.py
```
The embedding matrix will be saved in `./SoccerData` after you finish the above step. Finally, we use the DSED Model to glue all distributed representations of the play segments together.
```bash
python3 dae.py
```

### Testing
We provide a simple Top-K task for testing in [`estimate.py`](estimate.py)
```python
represent = get_result(source_int, embed_mat, source_letter_to_int, path1)[0] #the vector representations of plays
```
```bash
python3 estimate.py
```
